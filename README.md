I'm ali.kh.ebrahimi.</br>
If I want to say from the beginning, the only thing that
 Attached me to computer was computer games, insofar as I did not separate from my old friend at university, At first I thought the network was what got me into this field, But then i realized instead of playing games that made by others I can play games that i made them on my own, so, god willing, the best field to continue my education would be artificial intelligence.
